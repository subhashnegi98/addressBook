# addressBook
In this project I have used the HTML, CSS and JS at the front end and php at the back end and Mysql database.
so main purpose of this project that you can manage your contacts at one place. like(his name , phone no, email address, DOB, city with his photo)
and any time you can delete the contacts from your contact list.
